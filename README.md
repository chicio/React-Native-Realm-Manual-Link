An example project in which I show how it is possible to set up realm in an app with mixed native + react-native stuff without the use of `react-native link` command. This example has been created for my blog post  [React Native and Realm: custom manual link for an iOS app with custom directories structure](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2017/11/24/react-native-realm-custom-manual-linking-app-custom-directories-ios.html "React Native and Realm: custom manual link for an iOS app with custom directories structure").

### Description

This repository contains an example of an existing app with react native installed in a custom directory. On this app I then added Realm without the use of the `react-native link`, usually used to link native libraries to the iOS project. Below an article quote:
