An example project in which I show how it is possible to set up realm in an app with mixed native + react-native stuff without the use of `react-native link` command. This example has been created for my blog post  [React Native and Realm: custom manual link for an iOS app with custom directories structure](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2017/11/14/react-native-realm-custom-manual-linking-app-custom-directories-ios/ "React Native and Realm: custom manual link for an iOS app with custom directories structure").

### Description

This repository contains an example of an existing app with react native installed in a custom directory. On this app I then added Realm without the use of the `react-native link`, usually used to link native libraries to the iOS project. Below an article quote:

> What is React Native? It is one of the most successful and loved mobile development framework. It let you build *real native
mobile* application using Javascript. ... Cool :sunglasses:!!!! Isn't it? Write once, deploy everywhere and without losing the performance/hardware access
advantages of native code.
Most of the time the react native framework will help you also to manage dependencies inside you project. But sometimes, especially
if your project doesn't follow the classical react native directories structure you can find some problem in linking you external library.
While I was working on an existing native app integrated with react native only a few months ago with custom installation, I found
some problem to add Realm, the famous open source dbms, as a dependency to the project.
In this post I will show you an example of how you can add Realm to your app with custom react native installation. Let's start :cold_sweat:!!
